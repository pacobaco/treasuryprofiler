# TreasuryProfiler

TreasuryProfiler is a comprehensive tool for integrating and profiling financial and treasury-related identifiers into a data-driven system. The tool is designed to manage and process various identifiers, such as the Unified Social Credit Code (USCC), Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), Corporate Registration Number, and other financial identifiers commonly used in China.

## Features

- **Integration with Financial Identifiers:** Supports importing and profiling various financial and treasury identifiers.
- **Data Validation:** Ensures the integrity and accuracy of financial identifiers like USCC, TIN, and others.
- **Elasticsearch Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with Elasticsearch for scalable and fast querying of financial identifiers.
- **Easy Setup and Configuration:** User-friendly setup with minimal configuration needed to get started.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Elasticsearch
- SQLite (optional, for local storage)
- Dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pacobaco/treasuryprofiler.git
cd treasuryprofiler
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up Elasticsearch (if you don’t already have it running). Instructions can be found in the [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html).

## Usage

### Running the Profiler

To run the treasury identifier profiler, use the following command:

```bash
python profiler.py --input <input_file> --output <output_file>
```

Replace `<input_file>` with the path to the file containing the identifiers to be profiled, and `<output_file>` with the desired output location.

### Integrating with Elasticsearch

If you'd like to integrate the profiler with Elasticsearch for querying and storage:

1. Ensure Elasticsearch is running.
2. Modify the connection settings in the `config.py` file as needed.
3. Use the Elasticsearch interface to query and profile identifiers.

### Data Validation

The tool includes built-in validation for the financial identifiers. For example, to validate a USCC:

```bash
python validator.py --uscc <USCC_number>
```

### SQLite (Optional)

If you're looking to store the data locally for further analysis, you can configure SQLite in the `config.py` file.
